HTML template linking css and js
I always forget the sytax of linking js and css files in html file

so just putting it here for quick reference in future

```bash
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/layout.css" type="text/css">
</head>
```

and the Javascript file before the closing `</body>` tag

```xml
  <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

  
also good links to read on why we put where we put
