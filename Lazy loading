**This type of loading is called "lazy" because it encourages a web browser to procrastinate.**  
**\- damn, okay**

  
Lazy loading is a web and programming technique that delays the loading of non-essential resources—such as images, videos, or scripts—until they are actually needed by the user or the browser. Instead of loading all content when a page first opens (eager loading), lazy loading only loads resources if and when they are required, such as when the user scrolls down to view them or interacts with a specific part of the website.

## Key Benefits

* **Faster initial page load:** Only essential content loads first, letting users interact with the site sooner.
    
* **Reduced bandwidth usage:** Resources aren’t loaded unless necessary; this is especially useful for image- or video-heavy sites.
    
* **Improved user experience:** Pages load more quickly, even on slower connections.
    
* **Optimized resource utilization:** Less memory and processing power used up front.
    

## Common Use Cases

* Long web pages with many images or videos
    
* Infinite scroll feeds, news sites, or product listings
    
* Mobile sites where bandwidth and processing are limited
    

## Lazy Loading vs. Eager Loading

| **Feature** | **Lazy Loading** | **Eager Loading** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When resources load | When needed (e.g., as the user scrolls or interacts) | Immediately at page/application startup |
| Initial load time | Faster | Slower |
| Bandwidth usage | Lower | Higher |
| Implementation | More complex (requires extra logic) | Simpler |
| Best use case | Pages with non-essential resources, media-heavy sites | Small sites needing all content upfront |

Lazy loading is ideal for web applications and pages that are resource-heavy or have lots of content that isn't needed immediately. It improves loading times, saves bandwidth, and enhances performance, especially on devices with limited resources.

**How to implement lazy loading for images**

One way to implement lazy loading is to use the HTML attribute loading in an image tag. Adding `loading="lazy"`, as in the example below, tells the browser to wait to load the image until the user scrolls close to it:

```plaintext
<img src="example.com/image" alt="example image" width="100" height="100" loading="lazy">
```
