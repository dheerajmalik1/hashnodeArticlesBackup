Objective: To learn how CSS positioning works.

To make a specific type of positioning active on an element, we use the position property.  
  
Relative positioning::  
it's important to note that relative positioning can be applied to *both block and inline elements*. This allows us to nudge inline elements in a way that isn't really possible otherwise.

We can opt into Positioned layout using the `position` property. It can be set to `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`. Each one works in a unique way, like a mini-layout-algorithm within the layout algorithm.  
  
The default value of the `position` property is `static`.

Occasionally, you'll see tutorials refer to "statically-positioned" elements. All this really means is that the elements are *not* using Positioned layout; they're using some other layout mode, like Flow or Flexbox or Grid.

If an element is currently using Positioned layout and you want to opt out, you can set `position` to either `static` or `initial`:

```plaintext
.box {  /* Revert to its default value, which is ‘static’ */  position: initial;}
```
